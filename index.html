    <h1>Visual Studio</h1>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</p>
    <h1>Console log</h1>
    <p>The console. log() is a function that writes a message to log on the debugging console, such as Webkit or Firebug. In a browser you will not see anything on the screen. It logs a message to a debugging console. It is only available in Firefox with Firebug and in Webkit based browsers (Chrome and Safari).</p>
